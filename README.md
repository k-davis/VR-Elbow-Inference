# VR Elbow Inference
Can machine learning be used to estimate elbow location within VR? This project is an attempt to answer this question.

## About
This project is a Senior Thesis at Gonzaga University (CPSC 495, 496). Faculty Advisor: Dr. Kate Schroeder.

## Goals
The primary goal of this thesis is to discover whether machine learning can produce a better solution to the issue of elbow positioning than traditional methods, namely inverse kinematics.

## Timeline
Early work began in August 2019, and will continue through May 2020.
